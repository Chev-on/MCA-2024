# CB Music Analytics Portfolio - Vivaldi

## Week 1
### Theme - Vivaldi and his Four Seasons
The theme I have chosen for my data set is focused on the collection of pieces commonly known as "The Four Seasons" by the composer Antonio Vivaldi. Antonio Vivaldi was a very successful Italian composer and violin virtuoso in the Baroque era of music (17th - early 18th century). In his time, Vivaldi was a very busy composer and performer and is partially credited for the development of classical music, introducing and changing orchestral playing and violin techniques. In his lifetime Vivaldi composed over 500 concerti most of which were for string orchestra and soloist and solo violin. One of the most famous being a set of four violin concertos known as _Le quattro stagioni_, The Four Seasons. I choose this theme as this is one of my favourite collections of pieces, and I find it very inspiring.
